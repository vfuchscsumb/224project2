The idea of the application is for the user to upload an image in to the web page under the "upload" button, by doing this the image will be saved in our workspace under the "static folder" (project2/static).
Once this is done, the user will be redirected to another web page that will say "Almost there!" and "Click for your image". 
This way redirecting the user to the third and final page, with the new image that should have the facial recognition applied. 

What the user will se is:
    Face recognition in blue 
    Eye recognition in green
    Nose recognition in black
    Mouth recognition in orange
    Smile recognition in pink

A future project could be exchanging smiles between characters that are recognized.
